# lbc-expression-creator
A graphical tool for creating expressions in the Logic of Behaviour in Context using Blockly.

To use the expression creator, clone the repository and point your browser at `index.html`.

If you want to run any unit tests, you'll have to run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` from the root directory. This will get you the necessary Closure library files.
